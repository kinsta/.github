# Goals
The All In community will collaborate and build on research and initiatives that already exist to create immersive, end-to-end approaches to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion in open source. Our goals will be aligned across four pillars: Access, Community, Equity, and Data.

## Access

### All In for Students 
All In for Students is an online program for tech students from underrepresented backgrounds that provides open source education, training, and internship opportunities. 

**Who is eligible to participate?**
Students enrolled full time or part time at a:
- U.S. Historically Black College or University (HBCU)
- U.S. Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI)
- U.S. Women’s College
- U.S. Community College
- Any U.S. four-year institution and identify as a racial or ethnic minority

To learn more about the All In for Students program, check out our [website](https://allinopensource.org/access/). If you're interested in participating in the All In for Students Program, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMJM7ILztN9Mv1fjLZYN5GniJrcfP_0uG8VW7e3lBULmfohw/viewform). 


### All in for Maintainers
This program is an immersive program that provides inclusive development and training, and direct program management support to increase diversity within select communities through focused contributor acquisition and contributor retention efforts. Components of this program include training on unconscious bias that typically shows up in open source communities, accessibility audits, community hospitality, code of conduct analysis, and inclusive language scans and updates. The final program design will be designed with maintainers with insights from the [Open Source DEI Survey](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/linux-foundation-launches-2021-open-source-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-survey/), the [Maintainers Listening Tour](https://github.com/soyetubo/All-In/blob/main/README.md#maintainers-listening-tour) and the All In for Maintainers pilot.

## Community

### Maintainers Listening Tour
The Maintainers Listening Tour is a series of focus groups and individual interviews with maintainers who are interested in attracting and retaining new contributors with diverse backgrounds in an inclusive way. 

As a part of  the 2021 Maintainers Listening Tour, we collected best practices, lessons learned, and stories that highlight:
- What maintainers are doing to advance diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their communities;
- What is working well;
- What is not working well;
- What challenges they are facing that may be prohibiting them from creating a culture of inclusion within their communities; and 
- What they would like to see in a program that is designed for them, All in for Maintainers.

## Equity
All In will seek to leverage [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) which allows you to provide direct financial support to the maintainers and projects you love and the open source projects you depend on. We are developing a robust outreach campaign to increase the number of maintainers from underrepresented and/or historically excluded backgrounds and projects that serve under resourced communities. The campaign will also include increased funding to those projects as well. 

## Data
All In will prioritize consistently gathering and analyzing data that will provide insight into the current state of diversity, equity, and inclusion within open source, challenges that need to be addressed and strengths that can be leveraged to take advantage of opportunities to create a more inclusive culture within our communities. We will make informed data-driven decisions, ensure we have short term metrics of success, and monitor longitudinal data to measure long term impact. 

Our first initiative was to create the 2021 Open Source Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Survey and partner with the Linux Foundation to survey across the open source ecosystem. View the final report [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-research-reveals-new-open-source-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-trends-301444234.html). We are now collaborating with corporate partners to research inequities in computer science and other technical education programs.

# Renaming the default branch from `master`

Many communities, both on GitHub and in the wider Git community, are considering renaming the default branch name of their repository from `master`. GitHub is gradually renaming the default branch of our own repositories from `master` to `main`. We're committed to making the renaming process as seamless as possible for project maintainers and all of their contributors. This repository is our up-to-date guidance on how and when to rename your default branch.

We're not the only organization in the Git ecosystem making these changes: there are upcoming changes in the Git project ([statement](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/), [code change](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)), as well as coordinated changes from multiple vendors.

We're making changes to GitHub in a few phases, designed to cause as little disruption to existing projects as possible.

## What's already changed

- [We've updated GitHub.com](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-17-links-to-deleted-branches-now-redirect-to-the-default-branch/) to redirect links that contain the deleted branch name such as `master` to the corresponding link in the repository's new default branch.
- [We've updated GitHub Pages](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-31-build-and-deploy-github-pages-from-any-branch-beta/) to build and deploy from any branch.
  - Note: publishing to the special `gh-pages` branch will still work the same as it always has, but now you can choose any other branch in your repository as the publishing source.
  - Note: If the branch used by GitHub Pages is renamed, your GitHub Pages site will be unpublished. Pushing a new commit to the renamed branch will republish the site.
- [We've added user, organization, and enterprise settings](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-08-26-set-the-default-branch-for-newly-created-repositories/) to set the default branch name for all newly-created repositories on GitHub.com. We're adding the same settings in the 3.0 release of GitHub Enterprise Server.
  - These settings cover repositories created through [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new) and the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/#create-a-repository). Git 2.28 added a similar setting to control the default branch used when you run `git init` on the command line. Learn more about the new `init.defaultBranch` setting in [the Git 2.28 blog post](https://github.blog/2020-07-27-highlights-from-git-2-28/#introducing-init-defaultbranch).
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) has introduced a default branch setting for new repositories.
- [We've made it easier to rename an existing branch](#rename-existing)
- [We've updated Gists to use your preferred branch name](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-02-10-gists-now-support-alternative-default-branch-names/)
 
## New repositories use `main` as the default branch name

The default branch name for new repositories created on GitHub is now `main`. To set a different default:

1. For [users](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-your-repositories), on the https://github.com/settings/repositories page
2. For [organization owners](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/managing-the-default-branch-name-for-repositories-in-your-organization), on the `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR-ORGANIZATION/settings/repository-defaults` page
3. For [enterprise administrators](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-enterprise-account/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise-account#enforcing-a-policy-on-the-default-branch-name), on the `https://github.com/enterprises/YOUR-ENTERPRISE/settings/member_privileges` page

Users, organizations, and enterprises that previously selected a default branch for new repositories are not impacted by this change. Existing repositories are also not impacted by this change.

### Why main?

`main` is the most popular replacement for `master` that we're seeing across GitHub. We like it because it's short, it keeps your muscle memory intact, and it translates well across most languages. We're using `main` for our newly-created repositories and for the repositories we're moving now, like [dependabot-core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core).

## Renaming existing branches

You can now rename any branch, including the default branch, from the web.

![Rename default branch dialog](rename-default-branch-dialog.png)

Renaming a branch will:

- Re-target any open pull requests
- Update any draft releases based on the branch
- Move any branch protection rules that explicitly reference the old name
- Update the branch used to build GitHub Pages, if applicable
- Show a notice to repository contributors, maintainers, and admins on the repository homepage with instructions to update local copies of the repository
- Show a notice to contributors who `git push` to the old branch
- Redirect web requests for the old branch name to the new branch name
- Return a "Moved Permanently" response in API requests for the old branch name
